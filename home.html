        Thickets of pin cherry saplings, <br>
        burst into bloom in early spring to add unexpected beauty to the most mundane and neglected landscapes. <br>
        These small trees sprout and thrive in full sun along highways; <br> 
        and disturbed sites in forests where the trees have been blown down. <br>
        because they prepare the way for the less sun tolerant but longer-lived trees that follow. <br>
        This is the first phase in the process of forest succession.

    <h2 class="page2">
        A cherry is the fruit of many plants of the genus Prunus, and is a fleshy drupe. <br>
        Commercial cherries are obtained from cultivars of several species, <br> 
        such as the sweet Prunus avium and the sour Prunus cerasus.
    </h2>

    <h2 class="page3">
        Prunus serotina, commonly called black cherry, wild black cherry, rum cherry,<br>
        or mountain black cherry, is a deciduous tree or shrub of the genus Prunus.
    </h2>
    <h2 class="page4">
        Black cherry is the largest cherry native to Kentucky. <br>
        It grows best in forests with deep soils; however, trees occur in hedgerows <br> 
        and along county roads because birds spread the seeds.
